# GenerateStrongPassword
generates a strong password
This program is meant to generate a random strong password.
It uses upper case, lower case, numerical, and symbolic characters.
You can choose to exclude certain characters as well.

Currently working/adding/debugging on features:
1. excluding characters will give you a lesser length password than the user specifies.
2. PrintStream feature - to be added.
3. Will gather data on whether users prefer password separated character by character or just 
   the whole password.
4. may change the "how many passwords to generate" feature to a loop.
5. You will be able to specify which accounts for which passwords.
6. WILL TRY - will try to have the passwords generated saved into your notes ... or maybe make an app
   that saves all your passwords? 
7. OVERALL will try to clean up code and reduce unecessary redundance (haha get it). 

This is just a rough draft! contact me if you wanna work on it w me?
